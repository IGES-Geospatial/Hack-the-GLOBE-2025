The dominant organizing principle of human reality is information. The main obstacle to effective action is inefficient coordination and the lack of a shared understanding of where the “box” truly is.

Being able to handle data abstractly, synthesize the information it contains, and then communicate that understanding in a way that helps others recognize and understand the systems that shape us all is foundational to effective coordination.

Groundwork

* Be aware - the subject matter of this research experience is as close to what modern hands-on data science really looks like as I could possibly make it in the time allotted. Some background concepts may be mentioned but not covered directly. If a particular subject warrants more time and attention, say so.
* If you have a targeted interest and research it independently, share what you find.
* This work parallels and complements the work that your mentors are doing, and your collaboration with us and with each other is essential to making this a success for all involved.
* You all have different backgrounds and interests, but you have enough in common to have decided to join together in this experience.
* This experience doesn’t exist yet- we create it together, so collaborate, help each other, explore, challenge yourselves, challenge each other, challenge us, challenge the system. That’s the true hacker ethos, so let’s have fun and learn something along the way.

What we actually have

* Tables, columns, “data” stored in a relational database. Unlabeled data (no clear training and test sets) - supervised learning approaches are out (for now)
* The GLOBE data system has a 30 year history, and it has been shaped via many hands making changes across the decades, not all of which have been formally documented. This is not dissimilar to the challenges faced by institutions and businesses everywhere. The skills and thought processes required for this project are applicable to industry, community, and research alike.

What we need

* Interpretable information otherwise hidden in the obfuscated relational structure, the ability to detect and account for artefacts of system design

In short

* We must act as data archaeologists to fully understand the data we have before we can hope to offer sound guidance or make reliable predictions built upon that data.

Context

* This is a recurrent theme in information processing and data science (and in my book, all science is data science) interpreting the structure of data is prerequisite to uncovering the story that data tells (and data archaeology often plays a role)
* It’s also a basic life skill (critical thinking, skepticism) - what am I being told? Who or what is telling me? What assumptions and/or motivations have shaped what I’m now being told? Truly “hacking the globe” requires taking that same mindset to the world of information and systems we live in.
* That’s also why we are starting with a deeper slice of information than what is typically available through the API - we want to know which (if any) details, key to understanding the data’s structure and story, may not actually be getting surfaced for the scientific community.
