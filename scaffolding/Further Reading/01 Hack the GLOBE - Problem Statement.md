**Hack the GLOBE- Problem Statement**

There exists a 30-year dataset of citizen-scientist-collected observations of environmental variables. The full characteristics of the data are relatively unstudied, and this presents a hurdle for adopting the data into scientific research.

*Objective:* Explore and characterize the dataset via a well-documented, repeatable pipeline that assigns human-interpretable data flags on a per-observation basis. (Outliers, identifiable groups, classifiable errors, etcâ€¦)

**Why it matters**

This is the world we are living in \- anything easily scraped, processed, interpreted by AI has already been ingested. The pockets of data that remain are not as easily interrogable. The focused direction of logic (and application of AI where appropriate) is where humans still shine. Keep the human in the loop\!
