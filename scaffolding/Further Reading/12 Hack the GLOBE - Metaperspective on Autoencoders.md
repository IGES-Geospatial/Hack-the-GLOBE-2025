In the background, I’ve also been working on my own version of a repeatable, well-documented data characterization pipeline. I have set up 2 versions, one with the same data set that everyone has been working on throughout this experience, and one that utilizes data from the API for the same time range.

As you’ve noticed, I have abstained from providing any direct code, and have done my best to leave the space open for your own initiative. As I said at the outset, my hope is that the structure provides just enough structure, and that the problem space is confined just enough that the combined output of our efforts will advance the collective understanding of the GLOBE data system.

I have done my best to avoid implying that there is any singular “right answer”, but that instead, even “partial answers” and unique findings, when documented, repeatable, and shared are really the core of knowledge building, open data science, and consensus.

There is no single tool that can solve all problems, and often there is a lot of effort required to even understand the problem space before the right tool for the job can be selected and applied appropriately.

One of the tools that came up in our discussion earlier was the class of neural network models known as autoencoders. Marlin experimented with using an autoencoder to predict a temperature value given all of the other variables in the dataset, and using the residual between the predicted and actual temperature as an indicator of “suspicious” data. I pushed back on the utility of that particular implementation of the tool, but not on the utility of the tool itself.

I hesitate somewhat to share this information at this late stage, because I don’t want to see a scramble to incorporate this model into your work (please don’t) \- but I feel I would be doing all of you a disservice to not provide some awareness that autoencoders can be incredibly powerful for characterizing even noisy datasets \- when they are well understood and implemented carefully within the broader data science framework we’ve been exploring. Here’s the scoop:

## **Perspective on Autoencoders**

An autoencoder trained on data of unknown quality can still effectively identify and characterize data quality issues, even without a "clean" dataset for training. And it works best not by predicting a singular output, but by “predicting” all of the possible fields and their relationships to each other.  

The success of this approach hinges on a key assumption: **the "good," high-quality data represents the dominant patterns in the dataset, while noise and anomalies are less frequent and less structured.** *Again, that assumption cannot be made without exploring and characterizing the data BEFORE modeling.*  

An autoencoder is forced to learn a compressed, generalized representation of the data in its bottleneck layer. To minimize its reconstruction error across the entire dataset, it must prioritize learning the most common structures. It essentially learns the "melody" of the data, treating the infrequent noise and anomalies as "static" that it doesn't need to model perfectly.

### **How It Works with Noisy Training Data**


1\.     **Learning the Norm:** The autoencoder is trained on the entire dataset of unknown quality. During training, it adjusts its weights to become very good at reconstructing the common, recurring patterns (the assumed "good" data). It will be less effective at reconstructing the rare, anomalous data points because they don't contribute as much to the overall training loss.

2\.     **Calculating Reconstruction Error:** Once trained, you pass every data point *from that same dataset* through the autoencoder.  
○      **Low Error:** Data points that conform to the dominant patterns will be reconstructed accurately, resulting in a **low reconstruction error**. These are considered high-quality.  
○      **High Error:** Data points that are noisy or anomalous will be poorly reconstructed because the model never learned their specific, rare structure. This results in a **high reconstruction error**, flagging them as potential low-quality data.

Think of it as the model developing a "concept" of what normal data looks like. Anything that doesn't fit this concept is flagged.

### **Characterizing the Data Beyond a Single Score**


You can do more than just label data as "good" or "bad." The autoencoder allows for a more nuanced characterization of your data quality.  
●      **Feature-Level Error Analysis:** Instead of calculating one error score for an entire data record, you can calculate the reconstruction error for **each individual feature**. This helps you pinpoint exactly *where* the problem lies. For example, a record might have a very high error only in the temperature and sample\_number columns, suggesting a data entry issue specific to those fields.  
●      **Clustering Anomalies:** You can take the data points with the highest reconstruction errors and **cluster them**. This can reveal different *types* of data quality problems. For example, one cluster of anomalies might represent sensor failures, while another might represent fraudulent activity. This is done by clustering the data points based on their compressed representation from the encoder's bottleneck layer.

### **Important Considerations**


●      **Systematic vs. Random Noise:** This method works best when noise is relatively random or anomalies are rare. If your dataset contains a large amount of **systematic noise** (e.g., more than 40-50% of the data is corrupted *in the same way*), the autoencoder might mistakenly learn this noise as the "normal" pattern. *Without exploring and understanding the data first, you can’t be confident in the meaning of output from any advanced model.*  
●      **Denoising Autoencoders:** For our scenario, using a denoising autoencoder may prove to be the most appropriate tool for the job. This variant is trained by intentionally adding a small amount of random noise to the input data and then tasking the model with reconstructing the *original, pre-noise* version. This forces the model to become even more robust at separating the underlying signal from random fluctuations, making it better suited for inherently noisy datasets.

The analytical exploration and flagging you have done will allow for verification of the assumptions noted above, and will also facilitate the interpretability of outputs. If a cross-referencing of outputs between the denoising autoencoder I’ve deployed against the data from the API largely identifies the same clusters and characteristics as the one deployed against this “deeper” slice of data, the flags and clusters you’ve identified in your work will simplify interpretation of any signatures caused by the data system itself. If the two models do not overlap in their identification of clusters and characteristics, that would suggest that the view of the data as it is presented through the API may be insufficient to allow for full interpretability, and again \- all of your work will help to explain those differences.
