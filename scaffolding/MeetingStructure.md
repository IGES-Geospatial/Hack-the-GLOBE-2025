The daily synchronous sessions with all interns and mentors served multiple purposes and were structured to encourage meaningful two-way communication between interns and mentors.

Synchronous sessions began with interns delivering a quick report out, addressing the following questions as a 3-slide presentation:

1) Where am I?
   *What are you working on, learning about, intrigued by?*
2) Where am I going?
  *What is your current objective? How does that fit into your longer term vision?*
3) What obstacles am I facing?
  *Technical obstacles? Temporal obstacles? Life demands? What do you need to do or learn in order to get where you want to go?*

The motivation of this approach was to not only reinforce the habit of critical self-evaluation and re-orientation as a valuable tool when tackling abstract challenges, but to enable the mentors to identify common objectives and challenges and provide appropriate guidance. It also allowed the interns to learn from each other and encouraged collaboration along shared lines of inquiry during the "unsupervised" time which constituted the majority of working hours.

The "ice breaker" on day one was used to set the tone for subsequent meetings, and followed a similar structure as the student report-outs

1) Who am I? Where am I from?
  *Basic biographic information*
2) What is the coolest thing you've done with technology?
  *A chance to share interests, specific projects students are proud of*
3) What new skill or ability do you hope to develop during this Hackathon?              
  *How would you like to apply this skill in the future?*                                             
  *Any other hobbies or interests besides computing you'd like to share?*
